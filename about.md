If you've not already worked it out, my name is Tom.

This is not a CV! If you're interested in me in professionally
your best bet is to look me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-wigley-6482a451/">LinkedIn</a>.
Where you will find far more information than I can attempt to convey in this little page!

My current focus is on DevOps, platforms, networking and not writing horrible code.

Generally I spend my days talking to developers, helping make sure we end up with a servicable product while trying to make their
and everyones life a little easier through testing, continuous integration and automation.

Some more things might appear here at some time if they're noteworthy :)
