        		<h2>Hi again :),</h2>
				<p>If you've not already worked it out, my name is Tom.
				<br>
				<br>First of all, this is not a CV. If you're interested in me in professionally
				your best bet is to look me up on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-wigley-6482a451/">LinkedIn</a>.
				Where you will find far more information than I can attempt to convey in this little page!</p>
				<br>
				<p>My current focus is on DevOps, platforms, networking and not writing horrible code.
				<br>
				Generally I spend my days talking to developers, helping make sure we end up with a servicable product while trying to make their
				and everyones life a little easier through testing, continuous integration and automation.</p>
